# Image-Classification-Deep-Learning-Model

Built, trained and deployed a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model for image classification.

Used ready-to-use human and dog breed pictures to detect dogs and humans.

2 methods are utilized for building a CNN classifier throughout this project: 

1. Built a CNN model finetuning hyperparameters trying multiple times. Saved the model parameters for future use.

2. Using Transfer Learning method, re-trained an already existing image classification model to use in dog breed identification.
